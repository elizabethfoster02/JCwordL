## Acknowledgements

I would first like to acknowledge theotarr for creating the free and open-source Latin Wordle. This project was created for the fun and games section of the National Junior Classical League's 69th Convention. This Wordle utilizes the structure of the Latin Wordle and original Wordle, as well as the Latin Wordle's wordlist.

The JCL Wordle includes both Latin and English words in the wordlist and answers vaguely relate to JCL Convention.

### To Run Locally

Clone the repository and perform the following command line actions:

```bash
$ cd latin-wordle
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
