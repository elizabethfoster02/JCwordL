## About

This project was created for the fun and games section of The Convention Ear for the National Junior Classical League's 69th Convention and is similar to the traditional implementation of Wordle, but this version includes two langauges, English and Latin. All answers relate to the convention. The goal of this implementation is to entertain those just beginning to learn Latin, those who know a lot of Latin, and those who "have forgotten more Latin than you will ever know." To achieve this, I implemented both an Easy Mode and Hard Mode. All players initially begin in Hard Mode and may switch to Easy Mode. Easy Mode informs the player which language the answer is in. Additionally, I made aesthetic changes to theme the app with purple and gold, the JCL's colors.

I really enjoyed working on this project because for the first time, I was able to read an existing implementation in react and typescript and make the necessary changes in a way that felt fluent. This project is the intersection of my developing software engineering skills and my investment in the NJCL as the NSCL Editor. I am excited to share this project with over 1,000 convention attendees.

## Acknowledgements

I would first like to acknowledge theotarr for creating the free and open-source Latin Wordle. This Wordle utilizes the structure of the Latin Wordle and original Wordle, as well as the Latin Wordle's wordlist. Thw English wordlist were sourced from cwackerfuss's react-wordle implementation. The words chosen for the days of this convention were sourced from the National Senior Classical League Facebook Group and beta-tested with a group of Junior and Senior Classical League members.

The JCwordL includes both Latin and English words in the wordlist and answers vaguely relate to JCL Convention.
